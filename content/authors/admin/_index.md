My name is Zjian Hu (胡子键 in Chinese). I was born is Beijing, China and lived there for more than 20 years.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate of Civil and Environmental Engineering under the supervision of Dr. [Wei Ma](http://weima171.com/) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Before pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I obtained the B.S. degree of Computer Science in the Beijing Normal University. My Final Year Project advisor is [Hao Wu](http://aien.bnu.edu.cn/faculty/hao-wu/)/. The key word of my current research interests is large-scale, including but not limited to large-scale traffic simulation, large-scale traffic control and management, and large-scale Dynamic User Equilibrium (DUE).
